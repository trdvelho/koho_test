# KOHO - Challenge test


## Challenge informations:
## Techonology / Languages
  - Business logic created using Angular service / javascript / typescript
  - front-end created using Ionic / Angular / typescript

## Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/trdvelho/koho_test.git
$ cd koho_test/koho
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
## Debugging info
There is a console.log inside the Service that logs each outPut object as it is processed

## Challenges of the challenge
It was really nice to solve this challenge. At first I had a few doubts at the beginning but by reading the documentation very carefully I could understand all the rules.

I was required to use the basic functions of arrays (map, filter, reduce) as well as Observable to send data to the front-end to show the outPut informations.

## CONCLUSION

I believe I could achieve the challenge's goal and by doing that I hope to be able to have the chance to move forward in the process.
